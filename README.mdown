# Coursework - Advanced Data Structures in Java

This repo is a collection of courseworks I did when I took the Advanced Data Structures in Java course via coursera. From this course, I have learned the central data structure in the course: Graphs; found shortest paths in weighted graphs via AStarSearch and Dijkstra; Route planning and NP-hard graph problems.
